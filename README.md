# Machine Learning Car
Machine Learning Car is a high school project I built using machine learning to learn to drive a race track.
**This project is not finished** yet and the code is not very optimised, but due to other, higher-priority projects I'm working on right now, I didn't find the time to fully finish this project, including this README. It's been sitting around for a while now, so I decided to just open-source it.

Feel free to play around with it!
